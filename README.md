# Retail-Recap-Flip-Drop-System
When operating Retail Recap, I used this Python program to send out information via webhooks and the Discord API.

The program called flip-notification.py is used for profitable items to run restocks on and flip. The program called drop-notification.py is used for items that drop or release at a certain time that can be flipped for a profit.

In each program information on the product is needed to be inputted before sending out the embeds.
